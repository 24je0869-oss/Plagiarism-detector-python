"Plagiarism Detection System"

This project is a simple code plagiarism detection system that calculates similarity between two source code files using token-based comparison techniques.

Overview:-
The system reads two source code files, preprocesses them, and computes a similarity percentage based on common tokens. It helps in identifying logical overlap between programs and can be used in academic or learning environments.

Features:-
- Token-based similarity analysis
- Ignores formatting and whitespace differences
- Outputs similarity percentage
- Easy to extend for multiple files or languages
Technologies Used
- Python
- Regular Expressions
- File Handling

How It Works:-
1. Reads two code files as input
2. Tokenizes the source code
3. Compares common tokens
4. Calculates similarity score

How to Run:-
```bash
python plagiarism.py
